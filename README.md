# ArcadeApp
An application that will house multiple 2D arcade games

This is a reupload of a previous repo but now contains .gitignore file.
For clarity, this project has been active since September 2019.

The reupload contained engine files such as input, maths library, graphical files such as screen buffer and colours, and also contruction of basic primitive shapes.
Additionally it also contained App internals such as game and arcade states.
